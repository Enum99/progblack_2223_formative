            <p>
              Military applications of AI have become a prominent topic of
              interest in the field of artificial intelligence. With new ways of
              using AI constantly developing, it can be challenging to keep up
              with ways in which it can aid military operations. As AI becomes
              more essential, military dominance won’t be defined by the size of
              an army, but by the performance of its algorithms.
            </p>

            <p>
              Artificial intelligence is defined as the development of computer
              systems able to perform tasks that normally require human
              intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition,
              decision-making, and translation between languages. As they become
              more sophisticated, AI systems prove their usefulness more and
              more every day in all areas of life.
            </p>
            <p>
              The U.S. military has been using AI for many years, even before AI
              became commonplace in civilian life. Over time, AI has developed
              to be able to perform more complex jobs, and has almost eliminated
              the need for human input in certain situations. From processing
              data to combat simulation, AI can be used to perform many
              different jobs in the military.
            </p>
            <p>AI can benefit the military in numerous ways including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Warfare systems</li>
              <li>Strategic decision making</li>
              <li>Data processing and Research</li>
              <li>Combat Simulation</li>
              <li>Target Recognition</li>
              <li>Threat Monitoring</li>
              <li>Drone Swarms</li>
              <li>Cybersecurity</li>
              <li>Transportation</li>
              <li>Healthcare</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Military applications of AI have become an essential part of the
              military’s functioning. Awareness of the potential of AI is vital
              to leveraging it for modern military operations.
